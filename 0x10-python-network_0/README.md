# 0x10-python-network_0

This directory comprises bash scripts for manipulating requests and responses, alongside Python source code files. The creation of this project was a requisite for my ALX course. The key concepts covered include URL, HTTP, HTTP Cookies, HTTP Request & Response, and the utilization of Curl for HTTP Requests.

To execute the bash scripts, they have all been designated as executables. You can run bash scripts as follows:
 	./script
